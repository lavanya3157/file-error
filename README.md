# file-error
commom errors occurs while file uploading
When everything runs successfully but one file causes an error (common reasons)

-->Permission problem – File exists but access is denied
 -->File format mismatch – Code expects CSV/JSON but file is different
 -->Encoding issue – UTF-8 vs other encodings
 -->Corrupted or empty file – File loads but contains no valid data
--> Schema/structure mismatch – Columns or data types don’t match expected format
 -->Dependency issue – Required library not installed or version mismatch
--> Relative vs absolute path error – Path works for others but fails for one file
